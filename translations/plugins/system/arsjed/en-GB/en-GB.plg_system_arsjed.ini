PLG_SYSTEM_ARSJED="System - Akeeba Release System integration with Install from Web"
PLG_SYSTEM_ARSJED_XML_DESCRIPTION="Allows the Akeeba Release System's Latest Release plugin to produce URLs which work with the Install from Web feature introduced in Joomla! 3.2. If a user comes to your site from the Install from Web feature the generated URL will take the user back to their site's Extensions Manager page with the download URL pre-filled. You will need to have both this and the Latest Releases plugins enabled for this feature to work."
