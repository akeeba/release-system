	<h1>We have detected that you are running HHVM instead of PHP. This software WILL NOT WORK properly on HHVM. Please switch to PHP 7 instead.</h1>
	<hr/>
	<p>
        HHVM was Facebook's attempt at modernizing the PHP 5.x language and making it faster. Unfortunately it's also incompatible with PHP proper.
        PHP 7 has solved all these issues. It's fast, modern and <em>fully compatible with our software</em>.
        Please switch to PHP 7. If you are unsure how to do that, contact your host or the person responsible for maintaining your server.
        They are the only people who can help you configure your server.
	</p>
	<p>
        Kindly note that HHVM is not -and has never been- a supported execution environment for our software.
        As a result, if you see this message on your site you are unfortunately ineligible for support and / or filing bug reports.
        Please switch to PHP 7. If your problem persists after that we can help you / accept your bug report. Thank you for your understanding.
