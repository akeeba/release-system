        <para>In order to work, <application>Akeeba Backup</application>
        requires the following server software environment:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><trademark>Joomla!</trademark> 1.5.14 or later in the 1.5.x
            or 1.6.x range. It is a native component; it doesn't require
            Legacy Mode but can work with it if it's enabled.</para>

            not work on <productname>PHP</productname> 4! PHP 5.2.4 and 5.2.5
            <emphasis role="bold">are not</emphasis> supported because they
            contain grave bugs which will not allow Akeeba Backup to function
            properly. Akeeba Backup is also compatible with the newest PHP 5.3
            releases.</para>

            <para><productname>MySQL</productname> 4.1 or later.
            <productname>MySQL</productname> 5.0 or greater recommended for
            optimal performance. Even though Akeeba Backup may run on MySQL
            4.0, restoring the backup generated on such a host may be
            impossible.</para>

        </itemizedlist>

        <important>
          <para>Google Chrome 4 introduced a feature where it permanently
          "remembers" redirections. Since redirections are a key component to
          the internal working of <trademark>Joomla!</trademark>, using Google
          Chrome 4+ to administer your <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> site can
          lead to unexpected results, unless you are using Joomla! 1.5.17 or
          any later version. Therefore we <emphasis
          role="bold">strongly</emphasis> recommend upgrading your sites to
          the latest Joomla! release. Akeeba Backup does include workarounds
          for Chrome's behaviour, but we can't guarantee that anything else in
          Joomla! (including installation) will work smoothly.</para>
        </important>

        <para>In any case, you must make sure that Javascript is enabled on
        your browser for the backup to work. If you are using AVG antivirus,
        please disable its Link Checker feature as it is known to cause
        problems with several Javascript-based web applications, including
        Akeeba Backup and its tools.</para>

        <title>Installing Akeeba Release System</title>

        <para>Installing <application>Akeeba Release System</application> is no
        different than installing any other <trademark>Joomla!</trademark>
        extension on your site. You can read the complete instructions for
        installing <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> extensions on the <link
        xlink:href="http://help.joomla.org/content/view/1476/235/"
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">official help page</link>.
        Throughout this chapter we assume that you are familiar with these
        instructions and we will not duplicate them.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Getting the installation packages</title>

          <para>You can download the latest installation packages by visiting
          our site at <link xlink:href="http://www.akeebabackup.com"
          xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.akeebabackup.com</link>.
          Just click on the Download, Official Releases menu item on the top
          menu of our site. Then click on Akeeba Backup. The releases are
          listed with the newest release always on top. Click on it to view
          the files. If you are not a subscriber, click on the Akeeba Backup
          Core to download the ZIP installation package. If you are a
          subscriber to the Professional release (AKEEBAPRO or AKEEBADELUXE
          levels), please log in first. You should then see an item on this
          page reading Akeeba Backup Professional. Click on it to download the
          ZIP installation package.</para>

          <para>All Akeeba Backup installation packages contain the component,
          the backup notification icon module for your administrator area, the
          Lazy Scheduling plugin and all translation files. Installing it will
          install all of the above items automatically. The installation
          package can be installed on both Joomla! 1.5 and Joomla! 1.6 sites.
          It can also be used to upgrade Akeeba Backup; just install it
          <emphasis>without</emphasis> uninstalling the previous
          release.</para>

          <para>In any case, do not extract the ZIP files yet!</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Installing the backup component and language files</title>

          <para>Log in to your site's administrator section. Click on the
          <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>,
          <guimenuitem>Install/Uninstall</guimenuitem> (Joomla! 1.5) or
          <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>Manage</guimenuitem>
          (Joomla! 1.6 users) link on the top menu. In this page, locate the
          <guibutton>Browse</guibutton> button in the <guilabel>Upload Package
          File</guilabel> area. Locate the installation ZIP file you had
          previously downloaded and select it. Back to the page, click on the
          <guibutton>Upload File &amp; Install</guibutton> button. After a
          short while, <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> will tell you that the
          component has been installed. It will also let you know if the icon
          module and lazy scheduling plugin were installed.</para>

          <section>
            <title>Manual installation</title>

            <para>Sometimes <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> is unable to
            properly extract ZIP archives due to technical limitations on your
            server. In this case, you can follow a manual installation
            procedure.</para>

            <para>First, you have to extract the installation ZIP file in a
            subdirectory named <filename>akeeba</filename> on your local PC.
            Then, upload the entire subdirectory inside your site's temporary
            directory. At this point, there should be a subdirectory named
            <filename>akeeba</filename> inside your site's temporary directory
            which contains all of the ZIP package's files.</para>

            <para>If you are unsure where your site's temporary directory is
            located, you can look it up by going to the <guimenuitem>Global
            Configuration</guimenuitem>, click on the
            <guilabel>Server</guilabel> tab and take a look at the
            <guilabel>Path to Temp-folder</guilabel> setting. The default
            setting is the <filename>tmp</filename> directory under your
            site's root. Rarely, especially on automated installations using
            Fantastico, this might have been assigned the system-wide
            <filename>/tmp</filename> directory. In this case, please consult
            your host for instructions on how to upload files inside this
            directory, or about changing your <trademark>Joomla!</trademark>
            temporary directory back to the default location and making it
            writable.</para>

            <para>Assuming that you are past this uploading step, click on the
            <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>,
            <guimenuitem>Install/Uninstall</guimenuitem> (Joomla! 1.5) or
            <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>Manage</guimenuitem>
            (Joomla! 1.6 users) link on the top menu. In this page, locate the
            <guibutton>Install Directory</guibutton> edit box in the
            <guilabel>Install from Directory</guilabel> area. It is already
            filled in with the absolute path to your temporary directory, for
            example <filename>/var/www/joomla/tmp</filename>. Please append
            <filename>/akeeba</filename> to it. As per our example, it should
            look something like
            <filename>/var/www/joomla/tmp/akeeba</filename>. Then, click on
            the <guibutton>Install</guibutton> button.</para>

            <para>If you still can't install Akeeba Backup and you are
            receiving messages regarding unwritable directories, inability to
            move files or other similar file system related error messages,
            please do not ask us for support. These errors stem from your site
            set up and can best be resolved by asking for help in the <link
            xlink:href="http://forum.joomla.org"
            xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">official

        <section>
          <title>Installing the administrator panel icon module and Lazy
          Scheduling plugin</title>

          <para>These are automatically installed or upgraded when you install

        <para>Upgrading from <application>Akeeba Backup Core</application> to
        <application>Akeeba Backup Professional</application> is by no means
        different than installing the component. You do not have to uninstall
        the previous version; in fact, you are discouraged from doing so.
        Simply follow the installation instructions so as to install
        <application>Akeeba Backup Professional</application> over the
        existing <application>Akeeba Backup Core</application> installation.
        That's all! All your settings are preserved.</para>

        <bridgehead>Checking for the latest version and upgrading</bridgehead>

        <para>You can easily check for the latest published version of the
        Akeeba Backup component by visiting <link os=""
        xlink:href="http://www.akeebabackup.com/latest"
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.akeebabackup.com/latest</link>.
        The page lists the version and release date of the latest Akeeba
        Backup release. You can check it against the data which appear on the
        right-hand pane of your Akeeba Backup Control Panel. If your release
        is out of date, simply click on the Download link to download the
        install package of the latest release to your PC.</para>

        <para>Updating <application>Akeeba Backup</application> to the latest
        version is by no means different than installing the component. You do
        not have to uninstall the previous version; in fact, you are
        discouraged from doing so. Simply follow the installation instructions
        so as to install the latest <application>Akeeba Backup</application>
        version over the existing <application>Akeeba Backup</application>
        installation. That's all! All your settings are preserved.</para>

        <bridgehead>Live update</bridgehead>

        <para>There is also an alternate update path, if your server supports
        it. It is called the "Live Update" feature and it is available since
        Akeeba Backup 3.0.b1. Whenever you visit the Akeeba Backup Control
        Panel, it will automatically check for the existence of an updated
        version and it will notify you. Clicking on the notification allows
        you to perform a live update without further interaction. Do note that
        if your server is protected by a firewall you'll have to enable port
        80 and 443 TCP traffic to www.akeebabackup.com and joomlacode.org for
        this feature to work properly.</para>

      distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is
      not allowed.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">0. PREAMBLE</bridgehead>

      <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
      other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
      assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
      or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
      Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
      to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
      modifications made by others.</para>

      <para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
      works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
      complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
      designed for free software.</para>

      <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
      free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
      program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
      software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
      can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
      whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
      principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">1. APPLICABILITY AND
      DEFINITIONS</bridgehead>

      <para>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
      that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
      distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
      world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
      work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers
      to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and
      is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or
      distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright
      law.</para>

      <para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
      Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
      modifications and/or translated into another language.</para>

      <para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
      section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
      the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
      subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
      directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part
      a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
      mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
      connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
      commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
      them.</para>

      <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
      titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
      notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
      section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
      allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
      Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
      Sections then there are none.</para>

      <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
      listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
      says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover
      Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25
      words.</para>

      <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
      copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
      general public, that is suitable for revising the document
      straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
      pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
      drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
      automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
      formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
      markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
      subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format
      is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy
      that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

      <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
      ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
      XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
      PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
      transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
      include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
      processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
      HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
      purposes only.</para>

      <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
      plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
      this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
      which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
      near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
      beginning of the body of the text.</para>

      <para>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
      whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
      following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands
      for a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
      "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of
      such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
      section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</para>

      <para>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
      which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
      Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
      but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
      these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
      meaning of this License.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">2. VERBATIM COPYING</bridgehead>

      <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
      commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
      copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
      the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
      conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
      technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
      of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
      compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
      number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section
      3.</para>

      <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
      and you may publicly display copies.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</bridgehead>

      <para>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
      have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
      Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
      copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
      Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
      cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
      publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
      with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited
      to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
      satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
      respects.</para>

      <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
      legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
      reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
      pages.</para>

      <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
      numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
      Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
      Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
      network-using public has access to download using public-standard
      network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of
      added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
      prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
      to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
      stated location until at least one year after the last time you
      distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers)
      of that edition to the public.</para>

      <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
      the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
      give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
      Document.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">4. MODIFICATIONS</bridgehead>

      <para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
      under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
      release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
      Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
      distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
      possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the
      Modified Version:</para>

      <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
        <listitem>
          <simpara>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History
          section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous
          version if the original publisher of that version gives
          permission.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
          Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
          authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
          fewer than five), unless they release you from this
          requirement.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its
          Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
          Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document,
          create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the
          Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the
          Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the
          Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document,
          and likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the
          "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that
          was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if
          the original publisher of the version it refers to gives
          permission.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or
          "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in
          the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</simpara>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
      appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
      copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
      of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list
      of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These
      titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</para>

      <para>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it
      contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
      parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
      been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
      standard.</para>

      <para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
      and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
      list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
      Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
      arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a
      cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement
      made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add
      another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from
      the previous publisher that added the old one.</para>

      <para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
      License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
      assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</bridgehead>

      <para>You may combine the Document with other documents released under
      this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
      versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
      Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
      list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
      notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</para>

      <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
      multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
      copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
      different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
      at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
      publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the
      same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections
      in the license notice of the combined work.</para>

      <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
      "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
      Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
      "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must
      delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</bridgehead>

      <para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
      documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies
      of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is
      included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this
      License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
      respects.</para>

      <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
      distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
      copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
      License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
      document.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT
      WORKS</bridgehead>

      <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
      separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
      storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
      copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal
      rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works
      permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
      not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
      derivative works of the Document.</para>

      <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
      copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
      the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers
      that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic
      equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise
      they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
      aggregate.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">8. TRANSLATION</bridgehead>

      <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
      distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
      Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
      permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
      translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
      original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
      translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
      Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
      the original English version of this License and the original versions
      of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
      translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
      disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</para>

      <para>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
      "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
      Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
      title.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">9. TERMINATION</bridgehead>

      <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
      except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt
      to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
      automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
      who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
      not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
      full compliance.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS
      LICENSE</bridgehead>

      <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
      the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
      will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
      detail to address new problems or concerns. See <link
      xlink:href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/"
      xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
      http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</link> .</para>

      <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
      number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of
      this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option
      of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version
      or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
      Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
      number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
      as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your
      documents</bridgehead>

      <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy
      of the License in the document and put the following copyright and
      license notices just after the title page:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para>Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME.</para>

        <para>Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this
        document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,
        Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software
        Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no
        Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section
        entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
      Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para>with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
        Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
        LIST.</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
      combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
      situation.</para>

      <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
      recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
      software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
      their use in free software.</para>
